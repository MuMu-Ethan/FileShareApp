# FileShareApp

**A file sharing iOS app all made using the programming language swift including the backend server.**
The app and the server are both Xcode projects that can be downloaded directly to use.

The server uses your local area network for the file-transfer, change the IP address in the server and the app to the IP address of your network.

**Note: The app and the server are not made for practical and business use. It does not contain any security and privacy protections for users, and the server is not deployed online.**
