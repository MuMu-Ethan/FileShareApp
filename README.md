# FileShareApp

**A file sharing iOS app all made using the programming language swift including the backend server.**
The app and the server are both Xcode projects that can be downloaded directly to use.

The server will be started on http://127.0.0.1:8080. You will need to first run the server and then run the app on two simulators to start sharing files.

**Note: The app and the server are not made for practical and business use.**

Thank you for viewing this code and hope you like it!

## App

The frontend iOS app is made using swift and SwiftUI. The iOS app uses simple UI that includes features to refresh, upload, download, and delete the files.
